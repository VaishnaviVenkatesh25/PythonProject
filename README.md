Web Scraping of data Using Python   

This is a project to scrape data from the web and store the results in both a text file as well as the SQLite database.
1. (100 points) The CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ ) tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis. You will first write Python scripts that collect the list of Most Actives tickers only from the above website. Next, your programs should take these ticker symbols and build a comma separated text file (called stocks.txt) with data about each stock from the website: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1 which gives the quote for ticker symbol AMD as an example. The data to be collected from the Yahoo Finance site should include:
OPEN price
PREV CLOSE price
VOLUME
Note that the stock volume is an INTEGER type but the quantity obtained from the website may have commas. Your program should remove these commas from the volume quantity and store it as numbers.
In addition to the stocks.txt file, the data should also be stored in a SQLite database called StocksDatabase in the directory that your Jupyter Notebook code will be executed from. The StocksDatabase should have a table called StocksTable that contains the following columns and types:
Ticker TEXT OpenPrice REAL
   
PrevClose REAL Volume INTEGER
Every execution of your program should create a stocks.txt and StocksDatabase.db file in the directory (delete any existing files that you will create) that your Python script is located and run. We will be testing your output by verifying the following:
1. The program gets the list of Most Actives ticker symbols from the
https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ website and uses it to create the stocks.txt and SQLite
database
2. Verify that the stocks.txt file is created with the Most Active ticker symbols and the data
obtained from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote website in the comma separated text file format.
3. Verify that the StocksDatabase.db file is created and that the SQLite database contains the
StocksTable with the appropriate columns and is populated with the data. SQLite Browser may be used to verify database content.
